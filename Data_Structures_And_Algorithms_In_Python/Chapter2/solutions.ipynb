    "### R 2.15 The Vector class of Section 2.3.3 provides a constructor that takes an integer d, and produces a d-dimensional vector with all coordinates equal to 0. Another convenient form for creating a new vector would be to send the constructor a parameter that is some iterable type representing a sequence of numbers, and to create a vector with dimension equal to the length of that sequence and coordinates equal to the sequence values. For example, Vector([4, 7, 5]) would produce a three-dimensional vector with coordinates <4, 7, 5>. Modify the constructor so that either of these forms is acceptable; that is, if a single integer is sent, it produces a vector of that dimension with all zeros, but if a sequence of numbers is provided, it produces a vector with coordinates based on that sequence."
